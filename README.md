Software engineer in Europe's leading online fashion platform.

#### August 2021 - Present

I work in the infrastructure team that takes care of all incoming web traffic of Zalando.

Our team develops and operates [Skipper](https://github.com/zalando/skipper/) -
a HTTP reverse proxy Swiss Army Knife along with
[Kubernetes Ingress Controller for AWS](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kube-ingress-aws-controller)
that configures AWS Load Balancers according to Kubernetes Ingress resources.

We deploy these and other components across 200+ Kubernetes clusters
using [Kubernetes on AWS](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kubernetes-on-aws) configuration templates
and [Cluster Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/cluster-lifecycle-manager).

My daily activities include:

* learning something new ("Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted")
* reviewing pull requests
* helping teammates to solve issues
* troubleshooting and improving infrastructure components
* writing and refactoring Go (and YAML) code to fix bugs, create tools or add new features (see [GitHub timeline](https://github.com/AlexanderYastrebov))
* supporting our users (builders) - troubleshooting and suggesting improvements
* reading code (various languages) to support our users
* writing and reviewing Technical Design Proposals for infrastructure upgrades
* driving infrastructure upgrades

Infrastructure upgrade projects I participated in include:

* implementation of multi-tenant OAuth Authorization Grant flow at ingress
* rewriting production Kubernetes operator from Scala to Go
* switching default cluster loadbalancer type from AWS Application Loadbalancer to Network Loadbalancer
* various cluster upgrades that require careful planing and testing (e.g. deprecation of Kubernetes Ingress extensions/v1beta1 or CRD upgrades)

#### November 2015 - August 2021

I worked in the transaction handling team on the design and implementation of several software systems:

* Order processing
* Accounting transactions processing
* Customs data processing
* Business partner data management
* Migration of vintage applications to Kubernetes

I have also discovered several critical security issues and proposed fixes for them.
